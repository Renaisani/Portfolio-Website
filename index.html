                <h2>Porfolio Website(this)</h2>
            </div>
            <p>My goal with this website is to have an easily accessible place to display my most up to date resume and projects for potential employers to review. I set up the design with mobile styling along with layout concepts pulled from a mobile UI art page on Instagram, followed by applying two color palettes copied from colorhunt.co. Next I built a simple HTML structure for each section of the website, and proceeded to add all the styling to each of the sections. Since my initial design is meant for mobile, I used a Google Chrome plugin called Mobile Simulator for testing how designs would look on a handheld device. After finishing the mobile styles, I connected the frontend with a backend express server made with node.js. Lastly, when it came to deploying the app, from my experience using Heroku, Digital Ocean, and Railway, the latter is by far the simplest deployment option and was my option of choice.

                <h2>Weather API app</h2>
            </div>
            <p>I took on this project so that I could lean to build an app that could connect to an API and then implement that data into a product. I chose to use the open weather API for this project which allowed me to experience reading API documentation to understand how to fetch the data and then connect that data to HTML elements. I accomplished this by making HTTP requests to pull the JSON data from the API. From there I used Body Parser to extract the necessary data from the JSON object and saved them into variables that could be inserted into HTML elements.

                <h2>Remake of Williams Family Foundation website</h2>
            </div>
            <p>I originally made this website using WordPress(www.williamsfamilyfdn.org) for my familyâ€™s foundation. However, I wanted to customize more features and expand the website, so I decided to make it over from scratch. I recently finished recreating the homepage (links take you to original site) using HTML and SCSS. With that I used node.js and express.js to serve and deploy the website to Railway. After the experience of building numerous components in HTML and CSS, I knew how to intuitively implement an HTML structure that I could easily integrate responsive styling into. The next step is to finish the remaining pages as well as add a blog page that will use mongoDB as the database to store all blog entries.
